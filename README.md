Introduction
============================

Currently, the CAV is a major research topic in transportation engineering. However, when design the autonomous vehicles tech & algorithm, it is impossible to take the human factor into account. Human drivers have its own properties when driving. This repo contains the code that use the Akçelik acceleration & deceleration modeling. The properties of the  Akçelik's acceleration profile are:

- the acceleration begins from zero, and gradually increase to maximum and decrease to zero;
- the profile is a function of time. The controlling variables include the duration and maximum acceleration/deceleration. 

The acceleration profile, speed profile and distance generated by Akçelik model are as follows:
